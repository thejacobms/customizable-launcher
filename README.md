# customizable-launcher
This was a project for my Principles of Computer Science I class in freshman year at university. This was the first project that I have ever made programming, so it is fairly simplistic and the code is not really that good, disclaimer!

This launcher is designed to store the locations and extra information about programs that the user adds into it. It is stored in a JSON format and reloaded whenever the user launches the program again. The programs are stored in a list of icons on the left side of the launcher that the user can click to load up a page with the program and launch the program from there.
