This is a java GUI project that allows users to input their own programs and websites into it to allow fast and easy access to them. 

Users either specify to add a website or a game, then they are prompted to enter information to access the program, such as name of the program, description, URL if it is a website, and executable path if it is a game.

This is by no means a fully functional or even a good program. This was the first project that I created as an introductory project that I made for class.
